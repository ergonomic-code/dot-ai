# Markdown Conventions

## One Sentence Per Line

In documentation, prefer the following style:

* each sentence starts on a new line;
* lists use short bullet points;
* long blocks are split into subpoints.

Why:

* fewer merge conflicts during edits;
* easier to make targeted changes;
* more convenient for code review.

## Diagrams

Diagrams should be written in Mermaid by default.
See `conventions/diagrams.md`.
