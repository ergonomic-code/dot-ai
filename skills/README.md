# Skills

This directory contains reusable skills expressed as procedural specifications.
Each skill lives in its own directory and is defined by a `SKILL.md` file with YAML front matter.

## Engineering-log workflow

- [`initializing-engineering-log-task/SKILL.md`](initializing-engineering-log-task/SKILL.md) — Initialize an `engineering-log/` task directory from templates.
- [`formalizing-task-requirements/SKILL.md`](formalizing-task-requirements/SKILL.md) — Turn an informal task into a formal, testable problem statement.
- [`designing-solution-for-engineering-log-task/SKILL.md`](designing-solution-for-engineering-log-task/SKILL.md) — Produce solution options and a conceptual HLD for an `engineering-log/` task.
- [`generating-execution-spec/SKILL.md`](generating-execution-spec/SKILL.md) — Fill an Execution‑Spec template from the HLD results.
- [`exporting-chat-artifacts/SKILL.md`](exporting-chat-artifacts/SKILL.md) — Export the current chat transcript and brief for framework improvements.

## API design workflows

- [`api-design-cqs/SKILL.md`](api-design-cqs/SKILL.md) — Design and refactor APIs to follow Command–Query Separation (CQS).

## Testing workflows

- [`refactoring-http-tests-to-httpapi/SKILL.md`](refactoring-http-tests-to-httpapi/SKILL.md) — Refactor Spring/JUnit HTTP tests to typed `*HttpApi` clients.
- [`refactoring-test-setup-to-fixturepresets-and-testapi/SKILL.md`](refactoring-test-setup-to-fixturepresets-and-testapi/SKILL.md) — Refactor scenario test setup to `*Fixture` + `*FixturePresets` + `*TestApi`.

## Effects diagram workflow

- [`designing-effects-diagram-from-requirements/SKILL.md`](designing-effects-diagram-from-requirements/SKILL.md) — Build a new effects diagram from requirements.
- [`reverse-engineering-effects-diagram/SKILL.md`](reverse-engineering-effects-diagram/SKILL.md) — Reverse engineer an effects diagram from existing code.
